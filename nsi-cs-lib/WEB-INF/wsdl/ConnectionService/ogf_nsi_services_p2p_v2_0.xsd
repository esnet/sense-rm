                Type defining a generic point-to-point service specification.
                At the moment this type supports a unidirectional or
                bidirectional service.
                
                Elements:
                
                capacity - Capacity of the service.
                
                directionality - The (uni or bi) directionality of the service.
                
                symmetricPath - An indication that both directions of a
                bidirectional circuit must follow the same path.  Only
                applicable when directionality is "Bidirectional".  If not
                specified then value is assumed to be false.
                
                sourceSTP - Source STP identifier of the service.
                
                destSTP - Destination STP identifier of the service.
                
                ero - A hop-by-hop ordered list of STP from sourceSTP to
                destSTP representing a path that the connection must follow.
                This list does not include sourceSTP or destSTP.
                
                parameter - A flexible non-specific parameters definition
                allowing for specification of parameters in the Service
                Definition that are not defined directly in the service
                specific schema.
                
                ##other - For future expansion and extensibility.
