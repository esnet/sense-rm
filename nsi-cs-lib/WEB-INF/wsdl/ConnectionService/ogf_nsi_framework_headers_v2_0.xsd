                Type definition for the common NSI message header that is sent
                as part of every NSI message exchange.
                
                Mandatory Elements:
                
                protocolVersion - A string identifying the specific protocol
                version carried in this NSI message.  The protocol version is
                modeled separately from the namespace of the WSDL and XML
                schema to capture behavioral changes that cannot be modeled in
                schema definition, and to avoid updating of the schema
                namespace.
                
                correlationId - An identifier provided by the requesting NSA
                used to correlate to an asynchronous response from the
                responder. It is recommended that a Universally Unique
                Identifier (UUID) URN as per IETF RFC 4122 be used as a
                globally unique value.
                
                requesterNSA - The NSA identifier for the NSA acting in the
                Requester Agent role for the specific NSI operation.
                
                providerNSA - The NSA identifier for the NSA acting in the
                Provider Agent role for the specific NSI operation.
                
                Optional Elements:
                
                replyTo - The Requester NSA's SOAP endpoint address to which
                asynchronous messages associated with this operation request
                will be delivered.  This is only populated for the original
                operation request (reserve, provision, release, terminate,
                and query), and not for any additional messaging associated
                with the operation.  If no endpoint value is provided in a
                operation request, then it is assumed the requester is not
                interested in a response and will use alternative mechanism to
                determine the result.
                
                sessionSecurityAttr - Security attributes associated with the
                end user's NSI session.  This field can be used to perform
                authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement of end
                user requests.  Is only provided in the operation request
                (reserve, provision, release, terminate, and query), and not
                for any additional messaging associated with the operation.
                
                any - Provides a flexible mechanism allowing additional
                elements in the protocol header for exchange between two
                peered NSA.  Use of this element field is beyond the current
                scope of this NSI specification, but may be used in the future
                to extend the existing protocol without requiring a schema
                change.  Additionally, the field can be used between peered
                NSA to provide additional context not covered in the existing
                specification, however, this is left up to specific peering
                agreements.                
                
                Optional Attributes:
                
                anyAttribute - Provides a flexible mechanism allowing
                additional attributes in the protocol header for exchange
                between two peered NSA.  Use of this attribute field is beyond
                the current scope of this NSI specification, but may be used
                in the future to extend the existing protocol without
                requiring a schema change.  Additionally, the field can be
                used between peered NSA to provide additional context not
                covered in the existing specification, however, this is left
                up to specific peering agreements.
